There are two main files in this folder. The NCS.m file is the source code for NCS and could be used to reproduce the experimental results in the following paper:

K. Tang, P. Yang and X. Yao, “Negatively Correlated Search,” IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 34(3): 1-9, March 2016.

The benchmark_func.m file is for evaluation of candidate solutions, and is called by the NCS.m file. In case you need to test NCS on a new problem, this file needs to be modified.
